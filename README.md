# pizza-palace

A SQL, Express, Node, React app. 

It is designed to keep track of available Pizzas, display them to the user, and allow an admin to edit available pizzas.

Today, we're going to be building the REST endpoints on the server, and the database structure. 

## Initial Setup
1. Create a `server.js` file.
2. Run `npm init -y`
3. Npm install: `npm install express sequelize`

## Setup Express Boilerplate
1. Require express
2. Create an instance of express, called app. 
3. Create a PORT
4. Listen on the PORT.
5. Add body-parser middleware. 

## Setup the Database

## Setup Sequelize
